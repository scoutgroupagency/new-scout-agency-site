## Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated **15% of the African population has a disability**. This includes both visible and invisible disabilities, such as physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and mental health conditions. However, the true prevalence of disability in Africa may be higher due to underreporting and lack of data.

Individuals with disabilities in Africa often face significant barriers to inclusion, such as lack of accessibility, discrimination, and limited access to education and employment opportunities.

There are also disparities in disability within Africa depending on the country and region. For example, research suggests that individuals with disabilities in sub-Saharan Africa are more likely to live in poverty and experience food insecurity than those without disabilities.

> Overall, it is clear that individuals with disabilities in Africa face significant challenges and that more needs to be done to support their inclusion and access to services. It's important for policymakers, non-profits, and international organizations to focus on gathering more reliable data and invest in programs that will help people with disabilities in Africa to have a better life.

## Accessible Tourism

Accessible tourism is the ongoing effort to ensure that **all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities, have the opportunity to fully experience the world around them**. This proposal outlines a plan for making our tourism offerings more accessible to people with disabilities, including but not limited to individuals who are blind, deaf, or have mobility impairments.

Despite significant progress in recent years, people with disabilities still face substantial barriers when it comes to traveling and enjoying the world around them. Many popular tourist destinations and amenities are not designed with accessibility in mind, making it difficult for individuals with disabilities to fully enjoy their time away from home. Additionally, many individuals with disabilities face discrimination and prejudice when attempting to access tourism-related services.

## Proposed Actions

- **Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit** of current tourism offerings, including (but not limited to) hotels, restaurants, transportation options, and popular attractions. This audit will be used to identify and address any accessibility barriers that currently exist.
- **Develop and implement training programs** for all employees and contractors in the tourism industry, with a specific focus on accessibility and inclusion.
  - Create and distribute informational materials, such as brochures and videos, that highlight accessible tourism offerings and provide tips and resources for travelers with disabilities.
- **Develop partnerships with organizations** that serve individuals with disabilities, such as local disability rights groups and national organizations like the National Council for Persons with Disabilities and Lugha Ishara, to promote accessible tourism and provide support and resources for travelers with disabilities.
- **Establish a system for collecting and responding to feedback** from travelers with disabilities, to continuously improve accessibility efforts.
- **Establish a certification program** for accessible tourism offerings and promote these offerings through various marketing channels.

## Conclusion

Making our tourism offerings more accessible to people with disabilities is not only the right thing to do, but also good for business. By taking steps to remove accessibility barriers and promote inclusion, we can open our doors to a whole new group of travelers and help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to fully experience the world.

> This proposal is just a starting point, and we are open to any suggestions and feedback to make it more comprehensive. We believe that accessible tourism is important for everyone and we are committed to making it happen.

Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to the opportunity to discuss this project in more detail with you.

The hospitality industry is among Kenya's strongest drivers of employment and economic growth. However, people with disabilities are still largely underrepresented in the sector's workforce. According to the World Health Organization, employment rates for disabled persons across Africa remain alarmingly low, contributing to higher levels of poverty and social exclusion.

Barriers to entry include lack of accessible vocational training, workplace discrimination, and limited opportunities for skill development specific to the needs and abilities of individuals with disabilities.

## Objectives

- To assess the current state of training and employment opportunities for persons with disabilities within Kenya's hospitality industry.
- To identify best practices and models (locally and globally) for recruitment, training, and retention of disabled talent in hospitality.
- To recommend practical solutions for stakeholders—employers, educators, and policymakers—aimed at increasing representation and ensuring supportive, accessible working environments.

## Proposed Actions

- **Survey** hospitality employers and disabled job seekers to identify barriers to employment and training.
- **Evaluate existing vocational training programs** for people with disabilities; recommend improvements or new programs.
- **Facilitate inclusivity workshops** for HR managers and staff, with input from organizations representing people with disabilities.
- **Develop partnerships** with training institutions and disability rights organizations to pilot inclusive apprenticeship programs.
- **Monitor and report on employment outcomes** for persons with disabilities in hospitality roles.

## Conclusion

Expanding training and employment opportunities in hospitality for people with disabilities is essential for a fair, competitive, and inclusive Kenyan society. Action in this area will help unlock new talent pools, drive innovation, and demonstrate Kenya's commitment to equal opportunity in tourism and beyond.

      "Recommendation for Research on Digital Accessibility & Assistive Technology Adoption in Kenyan Tourism",
    slug: "recommendation-for-research-on-digital-accessibility-and-assistive-technology-adoption-in-kenyan-tourism",
    excerpt:
      "As Kenya's tourism sector continues its digital transformation, the accessibility of websites, mobile apps, booking platforms, and digital guides has become a critical issue. Many international and local travelers with disabilities rely on assistive technologies",

    content: `As Kenya's tourism sector continues its digital transformation, the accessibility of websites, mobile apps, booking platforms, and digital guides has become a critical issue. Many international and local travelers with disabilities rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers, captioning, navigation aids, and more. Unfortunately, most tourism-related digital resources in Kenya lack accessibility features, excluding a significant portion of potential visitors and exposing providers to reputational risk.

## Objectives

- To assess the accessibility of digital content and technology offerings by Kenyan tourism and hospitality providers.
- To identify cost-effective assistive technology tools and solutions for the sector's digital platforms.
- To recommend best practices for universal digital design, accessibility compliance, and enhanced customer experience for travelers with varying abilities.

## Proposed Actions

- **Audit a sample of tourism-related websites** and mobile apps for WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance.
- **Host a stakeholder workshop** with IT/marketing teams and representatives of people with disabilities to raise awareness and share practical solutions.
- **Develop a best-practices guide** for digital accessibility in tourism, including checklists for web/app design and procurement of assistive technology.
- **Pilot accessible digital solutions** in partnership with leading industry players and disability rights groups.
- **Establish a digital accessibility certification** for tourism businesses that meet or exceed industry standards.

## Conclusion

Investing in digital accessibility and assistive technology adoption will ensure Kenya's hospitality and tourism industry is welcoming and inclusive for all. This proactive approach strengthens the sector's global reputation and taps into a rapidly growing market of travelers with diverse abilities.
