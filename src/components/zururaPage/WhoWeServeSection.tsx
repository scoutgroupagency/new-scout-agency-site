              We serve children aged 6-18 from special needs and inclusive
              schools across Kenya, including those with physical, sensory,
              intellectual, and developmental disabilities.
            </p>
            <p className=" leading-8">
              We believe every child deserves the chance to explore, learn, and
              connect regardless of their physical or cognitive limitations.
              Our inclusive trips ensure that each child is not only
              accommodated, but also celebrated, supported, and empowered to
              thrive.,
